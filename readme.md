Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Below, you'll find solutions to various LeetCode problems along with explanations.

## Question 1: Two Sum

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Question 2: Selection Sort

### Problem Statement
Implement the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Question 3: Palindrome Number
